We added a starting game scene that plays an audio clip and requires the player to press a key to begin. In the main game, we implemented boundaries to restrict the ball's movement within a designated area.
Additionally, we introduced a projectile trail effect, where lines appear behind the ball but fade away after a few seconds.
